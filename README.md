# Processing Posters
I've been learning Processing and saw the [project by Oleg Frolov] (https://github.com/Volorf/Processing-Posters).  This bunch of posters inspired me so I decided to do my own ones.
## How to use the sketches
Download processing from [the official site] (https://processing.org/). Copy/paste my sketch to the program window and have fun.
